GPU SDR
=======
<p>This project enable the readout of superconductive resonators using Ettus&reg USRP SDR platforms and Nvidia&reg GPUs. The goal of the project is to allow users to modify and customize every aspect of the data acquisition: from the realtime signal generation and demodulation to the analysis techniques.</p>
